Name: Item, dtype: object",,,, No ,the tons of reading that we had to do,,"Well, the reading quizzes that are due almost the same day as the exams seems very impossible to do because it usually take quite a while for people to read through the text before doing the quiz and that the assignments due right after the midterm seems unreasonable. ",,"The condensed timeframe of this summer session course definitely posed a challenge, particularly the overlap of continuing on to new course material before taking exams (for example, we were assigned lessons 7 & 8 at the same time we were busy studying for Exam #1 on Lessons 1-6).  I also found it challenging that Exams #2 and #3 were scheduled so close together (within 1 week of each other).  Prepping for these two Exams almost concurrently was difficult. I believe that had we had more breathing room in terms of the pace of this course, I might have performed better on Exam #2.",,"Some times, I felt that the class discussions did not help me learn. Some responses (mine included) seemed manufactured.",No,The reading checks difficulty threw me off a little,no,the course timing was tough and the lectures didn't all correlate to quiz questions,,No.,,The fact that it is on online course but I don't really think that is part of the course because I am pretty sure this course has been taught in person.,,,,,,,,,No,"The weight of the exam. 75% of the grade based purely on the exam, makes recovering from mistakes almost impossible. ",,no,,,,No. ,,,naw,"I think the reason why everything is just so hard and why I didn't get the scores I wanted on my exams was because summer school is so short. The lessons had to be quick and the exams had to be early. I learn slowly and I need time to retain my information. This affected my exams and I did poorly. The material however was not that hard, it was just the amount of time to learn the material was the issue. ",So many assignments. ,,N/a,Nothing in particular affected my learning in a negative aspect.,,The pre-lesson quizzes seemed a bit unnecessary. Also at times the reading guides were way more detail intensive than they needed to be. I would also like to request that the repeat questions in practice exams be replaced because I feel like I missed out on a potential chance to learn. ,,Nope,No,,,"too many lessons, not enough time. no extra credit either",,,,Reading ,No. ,"There were video issues for the first 2 parts of all lectures for Exam 2. I would have brought it up, but I realized it as I went back to revise a couple of hours before the exam. ",,,,,Yes I think this class should not include liquor lecture. Exams are harder and some questions answers are confusing.,,None that I could think of.,no,no,,,,no,,,No,,I cannot get feedback on my reading guide,,No,,,No,No,,Multiple choice exam questions with multiple correct answers; confusing in the moment ,no,,,,,,"No, nothing.",,,,no,None,,no,"I think the exams were really hard and each question was worth so many points. I ended up doing really bad on them, and i've been having a hard time with it because I usually do really good in school. I've been pretty down and stressed about this course and my future classes after seeing how badly I did on the exams. It's gotten in the way when I try to study more and in my daily life because I'm constantly thinking about how bad I'm doing.",,,"I personally learn best when I do a bit each day, I could sometimes finish all weekly homework in just two and then forget about everything I learned for the rest of the week and during the exams. But nevertheless, I enjoyed the format.",,Health Problem,,,,"No, this was not the case at all.",,too much load.,,,no,,,,I think I will start consider more when I do cooking which may add more stress to me and after some hospital check up I was told that im currently suffering too much stress causing some physical breakdown. Seriously!,No,reading was too dense,,,Not much time to complete assignments,,,The workload.,No,Too difficult tests,no,,,,,the stress and frustration i felt when i didnt do so well on the 2nd exam and there's no hope of raising my grade to what i want it to be,no,,,The reading guide is not helpful for the exam review at all ,No,,,,No,,,,,,No,No,,,None,,Sometimes the workload became excessive and I felt overwhelmed which made me feel less motivated to try in this class subconsciously telling myself I will not succeed in receiving the A grade I desired.,,,,,i did poor on the test every time which makes me frustrated.,"I think having all the lecture and weekly review quiz deadlines on Sunday night allowed me to procrastinate them, which in turn negatively impacted my learning. For a motivated student, however, I don't think this course had any detriments.",,The video are YouTube videos so I had to use a VPN.,,"There were a ton of things: CONFUSING WORDING. I'm a Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering double major at UC Berkeley, and this was EASILY one of the WORST courses I've ever taken from a STEM perspective. Instructor was straight up LAZY and INFLEXIBLE. I feel like the only people who enjoyed the course were people who took it on a Pass/Fail basis. Instructor doesn't know his stuff that well. Some of what he said in class contradicts with the book readings. HIS EXAMS ARE SO POORLY WRITTEN. Easily one of the WORST professors I've ever had.

These disadvantages lead to my poor performance in the two midterms. The reason why I am not working as hard as I should have done is because I am focusing on my internship which is also my paid job during the whole summer. Therefore, I never concentrated on studying for this course when there were still some jobs left to be done. I need to work from 7 am to 6 pm everyday and donât have enough time to sleep or study. Most of my energy was spent on my job rather than this course. I totally understand that if I can push myself harder or focus less on my internship, I might be able to do better in this course. Therefore, I am preparing for the final and wish that I can do better i the last exam.",,,,,,,,,,,

studyplan_chgh    Please tell us how your study plan changed
Name: Item, dtype: object",,,,,It changed by studying a bit less than what i wanted ,,My summer plans are usually very flexible and I move my study plan around as long as I can finish them on time for other summer plans that come up during the week ,,"Instead of setting aside full days and putting off my coursework until those days, I evenly spaced out the required readings and assignments over all days of the week.  I spent on average about 5 hours every day on the assigned readings and coursework for this class. This is a huge departure for me, as I have a learning disability that typically compels me to hyper-focus (I develop ""tunnel vision"") on the material of one specific course at a time.  I was taking another class concurrently, and it was challenging for me to pull myself away from my other course to focus on this one and vice versa.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this new approach of balancing my attention between coursework for both classes actually helped me engage more fully in the subject matter, as I was engaging with it on a daily basis.  It also went really far in preventing the typical ""burn out"" and mental fatigue I've developed in the past. Another way I adjusted my study plan was to really focus on completing the reading guides very thoroughly.  I didn't quite understand their importance until we'd started, but after the first week, I saw how I grasped the concepts more thoroughly than I had in the past.  While getting a good grade in this class is important to me on a personal level, challenging myself intellectually and really GRASPING this course material is my ultimate goal.  Adjusting my approach towards my completion of the Reading Guides helped a lot in that regard.",,I put off activities until due dates approached.,,More in depth as the tests were more in depth than i thought,,I've now implemented about an hour of studying a day,,,I told myself to take notes for every lesson.,,,Squeeze all workload and finish within 2 days and get the work over with early ,I would add what was on the quiz to a study guide. Rather than read the entire chapter I would only focus on necessary part.s ,,,,I skimmed and read less,,I decided to complete many of the study guides completely.,Added more time and went through the reading guides slower,,"I focused a lot more on watching the lectures made by the professor, rather than focusing on spending a lot of time on the readings.",,It changed by progressively doing my work rather than leaving it to all one day or night. ,,,,,I just studied nights before instead of the day of and studied longer,"At first, I was organized and I had a set mindset. I thought I was doing great until the first exam. This exam lowered my grade a lot and I was freaking out. I tried to stay on track, but I kept worrying about making mistakes. After my second exam that didn't move my grade up, I had a breakdown. But my dad gave me advice and told me that I had to ""take small bites often"" rather than ""big bites or else you're going to throw up."" My study plan went from studying big chunks of material to doing smaller sections little by little. I think it's going well so far. ",I made study guides of every lesson to review the material before the exams. ,,I created a more structured study plan by doing one lesson a day,,,,,"At first, I review the class by looking at the reading notes and pictures I taken from class slides, but after take the exam, I feel it is not efficient, so I change the plan to take notes during videos and more focus on the video notes.",,,,I used the reading guide,,,,,Instead of planning to study 10hours a week I only did maximum 4 and because of this my grades went down. ,"I allotted more time for reading, and less time for the lectures. I used to prepare the reading guide Tuesday, and take the reading quiz the same day. Now I prepare the reading guide on Monday, revise it on Tuesday and then take the test.",,,,I started to review my notes more often whenever I had free time.,By watching videos twice ,,,Got pushed back a lot,I would push back my work for a day or two.,,,,,,,"I planned to mainly study by watching the videos, but the textbook could give more information. So I started reading the materials more careful.",,Make more time for the reading guide and notes.,,I went over my notes and watched all the videos again before exam 2 and almost got a perfect score ,"I did not work on the material everyday, rather I worked mostly when I had to complete assignments",,Some days I worked more than others so sometimes I wasn't able to complete everything I set out to do that day. ,,,,,,,"One of the big difference was there was a study guide to follow along the materials i was going to learn. Before I actually watch lecture videos, I try to know what I am going to learn at least. That is the major difference of my change. ",,,,,I had to change around my work schedule a bit so I would have time to complete my assignments. ,Make learning plans and allocation of time.,I read the book more thoroughly and took more time to do the reading guides.  ,Complete the plan during weekends,,,I ended up doing everything in 1 or 2 days instead of doing a little bit each day. ,,,"I had planned to be extremely proactive, finish all bioscience homework at least a day before it's due but I began completing it later and later eventually right before the time it was due...",So I put more effort on the online lessons.,,,I break down the works and review everyday,,,,I reduced the time I spent on this course.,,,I changed the days and times I originally planned to study/do work for this class when I needed to ,,,,the way I changed my study plan is to consistently take critical notes which helped me a lot in reviewing and memorizing things from the videos and pre-work,I reviewed the quizzes and tests online more. ,I worked harder on the reading guides,,"Due to the provided suggested study guides, I decided to follow it in hopes of learning the material. ",,,,,Read more book,,"Since my study plan changed through the course of the weeks, I found it quite difficult to manage my time in scheduling my time for research, classes and managing work. ",,,,,,,,,"Mostly the review guide, because sometimes I cannot follow the fixed plan, like keep reviewing for the number of hours on my plan.",,,,,,,,,I focus more on the videos. ,,I changed it to do a reading guide a day and then watch that same reading guides video to that day,I had to finish my assignments a lot earlier. I finished my all reading quizzes before doing any of the lessons because they were due at earlier dates. ,,,,,"Instead of taking the time to watch the lectures for this class, I would end up focusing on trying to complete the canvas assignments first instead of watching the lectures. However, I always made time to read the textbook.",,,Still donât do well.,,I reduce the time which was planned to spend on studying.,"Rather than doing one lesson per day, I tended to do the reading guides and reading quizzes on the day the quizzes were due, and pushed back the lessons and discussions later in the week.",,,,,,,"I started to pay attention to the lecture material a lot more, which I often find challenging in an online course.
